The code is optimized for the doubly linked list.
The code is basically has functions of 
insert_at_start:Element should be interested at the starting
insert_at_last:Element should be inserted at the ending
insert_at_after:In this we assume that already search function has been called and after that the element is saved in temp and element is added after temp i.e searched element.
delete_first:To delete the first Node
delete_last:To delete the last Node
delete_item:To delete the node of the particular searched data.
